### Introduction

- **Presenter**: Jerry, co-founder, and CEO of Llama Index.
- **Topic**: Future of knowledge assistants.
- **Focus**: Advancements and challenges in utilizing LLMs for enterprise applications.

### Current Use Cases of LLMs

- **Document Processing**: Tagging and extraction.
- **Knowledge Search and Question Answering (QA)**: Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques.
- **Conversational Agents**: Storing conversation history and generalizing QA interfaces into overall conversational agents.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Synthesizing information and performing actions across various services.

### Challenges with Basic RAG Pipelines

- **Naive Data Processing**: Simple parsing and chunking are insufficient for production-grade applications.
- **Query Understanding**: Basic RAG struggles with complex, broad queries.
- **Service Interaction**: Lack of sophisticated interaction with other services.
- **Stateless Nature**: No memory of previous interactions.
