# Explainable AI, or XAI
It's a set of techniques that help people understand how machine learning algorithms make decisions.

**Why is XAI important?**

- **Trust and Confidence:** People are more likely to trust and accept AI decisions if they can understand how they are made.
- **Model Improvement:** XAI helps developers identify and fix errors in AI models.
- **Fairness and Regulation:** XAI can help ensure AI models are fair and unbiased, which may be required by regulations.

**The "Black Box" Problem:**

- Traditional AI models are often like black boxes - their internal workings are mysterious even to their creators.
- XAI aims to open these black boxes and make AI models more transparent.

**Current State of Explainable AI (XAI):**

- **XAI Exists, But It's Evolving:** There are techniques for XAI, but the exact definition and best practices are still being developed.
- **Challenges with Complex Models:** XAI can be harder to implement on intricate AI models with many features or steps.
